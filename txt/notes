Presentation

intro
	hi, my name is tim, this is will, and we're two students from binghamton university upstate

	we decided to create a project with the mission to empower you with a terminal experience so good that you'll never have to alt tab away.
	We called it nlt, or Never Leave Terminal

nlt

help
	we're going to demonstrate two of our functions, using twilio and etsy through the command line.
	eric wu, swift, can we have your phone number to send you a text

twilio send 1209310391083 hello hackny!

now we'd like to show you how you can browse etsy using the terminal

etsy trending

	this command queries etsy for the current top 25 listings

	which one would you guys like to see?

to close out we'd like to show you guys one of the easter eggs here:
we've crunched the numbers and we've found an predicted caricature of a possible nlt user.
